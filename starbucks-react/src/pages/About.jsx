          Founded in 1971 in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market, Starbucks has always stood for more than just coffee.
          From our very first store, we set out to build a different kind of company — one that celebrates connection,
          inspires human spirit, and brings people together over a cup of coffee. </p>
        <p>
          Today, with thousands of stores around the world, we remain committed to ethically sourcing and roasting the
          highest-quality arabica coffee. We strive to create a welcoming space for everyone — a “third place” between
          home and work where community, creativity, and conversation can thrive. </p>
